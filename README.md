# AnalysisAndDesignProject2

This is a project for Analysis and Design course at SNHU



# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For my project, I was supposed to develop a course planner for ABC University. They wanted the students to preview the classes, their IDs, and the prerequisites they need to be able to sign up for that class.



# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

First I worked with pseudocode for opening the CSV file, then pseudocode for data structures. The data structures that I was analyzing were Vector, Hash table, and Binary Search Tree. After developing the code for storing the values within these structures, developing a pseudocode for the alphanumerical ordering of the courses, and reading the values from the structures, I was tasked to analyze a runtime analysis for each of the structures. After all of this work, I discussed the pros and cons of each structure and provided a recommendation. Last, I had to finish developing the code for the course planner.



# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The pseudocode had its challenges to understand how the structures work. After that, I had no experience working with runtime analysis and how to execute one. Nevertheless, I was able to overcome these with research and some practice. The biggest challenge was just waiting for me. The actual code was not the easiest to develop and had a lot of errors but eventually, it worked out and I was able to produce a working piece of code.



# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Before working on this project I had very limited experience with data structures and algorithms. This class in general gave me a great base and understanding of what algorithms are, how to develop them, what are data structures, and what they are used for. This will help me to pursue a career in the tech industry and help me to become a better software developer with a great understanding of industry practices and norms.



# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The more courses I take and the more code I develop my understanding improves, as does the readability and maintaining the code. The course helped me further improve these skills and helped me develop a better understanding of the practices that are commonly used in tech companies and within the coding community as well.
